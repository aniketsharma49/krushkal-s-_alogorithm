Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum cost spanning tree uses the greedy approach. 
This algorithm treats the graph as a forest and every node it has as an individual tree
A tree connects to another only and only if, it has the least cost among all available options and does not violate MST properties.
To understand Kruskal's algorithm let us consider the following example âˆ’
